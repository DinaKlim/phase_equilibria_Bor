TLDR: James Connolly's Perplex page https://www.perplex.ethz.ch/ and the examples https://www.perplex.ethz.ch/perplex_examples.html is all you need for calculating phase diagrams

My favorite thermodynamics course page is here https://www.perplex.ethz.ch/thermo_course/ - very useful for understanding what happens behind the Perpex' scenes 

# The fun part of my PhD

I like phase diagrams, so I wanted to take the composition of the massive sulfide from Bor and see if I can reproduce the observed mineral assemblages from the deep, high temperature porphyry part to shallow, low temperature part. 

The first step is to take the composition of the ore and calculate a phase diagram at a certain temperature; to do that with Perplex, one should indicate the pressure, too. I tried to come up with reasonable assumptions based on the depth of the ore formation, but after calculating 152 phase diagrams during the revision process, I saw that no matter what pressure you put into the calculation file, the boundaries on the phase diagram do not change. Temperature, however, influences these boundaries a lot.
